Stubhub Crawler
===============

This repo contains a number of utilities for collecting data from the Stubhub API, the primary one of which is the Crawler.  It runs forever, in ~6 second intervals (the free tier of the API allows 10 requests a minute), querying the api or loading events to query from the database.
